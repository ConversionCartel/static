        <p>
        As a parent, you want to give your child everything he or she needs to succeed in today’s world. Unfortunately, the traditional model of education is based on a very different work environment. This model no longer adequately prepares children for their futures and fails to give them the ability adapt to the fast paced world we live in.
        <br><br>
        Enter the Project <a href="#">Based Learning Model</a>.
        <br><br>
        Our unique education system does more than teach your child the state requirements for graduation. It prepares your child to thrive in the world after graduation and helps him or her become a productive, engaged member of his or her community.
        <br><br>
        At Avalon School, our goal is to prepare students for college, future careers and everything they will encounter in their lives. Along with the standard educational building blocks, we teach them invaluable skills, such as time management, goal assessment, project management, and communication. Our students learn how to identify their passions and, more importantly, they learn how to learn.
        <br><br>
        In addition to these skills, we teach leadership, collaboration and conflict mediation. Our school is based on a democratic model, where students make the rules and decide how things will run. This gives them the experience of creating their own learning environment and empowers them to make changes when needed.
        <br><br>
        We also value the individual. We provide a safe, nurturing environment where every child is valued for who he or she is and what he or she is passionate about. Students learn through creating projects that interest them and incorporate the educational standards required by the state for graduation.
        <br><br>
        Instead of being taught to take tests, your child will be able to research, create and complete projects that genuinely interest him or her. This model of learning will ensure the knowledge your child gains is retained and will give him or her experiences to bring forward into the rest of his or her life.
        <br><br>
        We’d love to talk to you about enrolling your child at Avalon School. You’re welcome to <a href="#">take a tour</a> or <a href="#">contact us</a> for more information.
