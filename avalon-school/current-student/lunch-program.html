        <p>After a student and guardian completes and submits Avalon’s Transportation Enrollment Form to the front office, either a Metro Transit unlimited ride or 10-ride bus card will be provided to students. 10-ride passes will be issued weekly on Tuesdays, unless otherwise specified by the front office.
        <br><br>
        Have you lost or damaged your bus pass? Replacement pass costs are as follows:
