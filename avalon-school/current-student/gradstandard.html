        <h3 class="content-headline">Graduation Standards</h3>
        <p>Graduation standards are the academics behind the credits that students earn here at Avalon. In order to graduate from Avalon, we require students to study the same academics that are required by any other public school in Minnesota. However, as per our charter, we re-wrote many standards so that students could more easily interpret the content and do projects in each of the subject areas. You may peruse either the basic checklist that gives the titles to all of the standards, or the detailed list to get a better idea of how specific standards are written.

        <h3 class="content-subhead">Four Year Plan</h3>
        <p>Is your student on track to graduate in 4 years?
        <br>
        Students in the high school need to be making progress on two different fronts at the same time: credits and standards.

        <h3 class="content-subhead">CREDITS:</h3>
        <p>
        In order to graduate from Avalon in four years, students need to earn at least 10 credits each year.  They need 40 credits to graduate. One credit is the equivalent of 100 hours of work.  Students earn credits through both projects and seminars by completing work AND logging their hours on Project Foundry.  Projects and seminars can earn any amount of credit- it all depends on how many hours the student worked, as well as how many hours they logged on Project Foundry.  For example, an independent project might take the student 37 hours to complete.  Upon finalization, that student would earn .37 credits.

        <h3 class="content-subhead">STANDARDS:</h3>
        <p>
        The state of Minnesota requires that students complete a wide variety of graduation standards in order to earn a diploma.  Students earn standards through seminars and projects.  It is the job of the studentsâ€™ advisors to monitor progress and to advise the students about standards that they need to complete.  It is wise to address some standards in each of the core areas (Math, Social Studies, Science, and Language Arts) every year.

        While the path to graduation looks different for every student, many find this generic outline useful: <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ave81.com/file/d/0ByodckRnfd50YVlwX1E2bno5ZDA/edit">Four Year Plan.</a></p>
