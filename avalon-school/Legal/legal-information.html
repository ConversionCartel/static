        <p>
        For over a decade, Avalon School has pioneered two separate, powerful models of education: a Project Based Learning curriculum and a Teacher-Powered governance model. We strongly believe that these two aspects have the capacity to change education, and we are eager to share our experience.
        <br><br>
        Starting in the 2015-2016 school year, Avalon is now offering an array of professional development services, from short, student-led tours to several day immersive experiences.  
        <br><br>
        To learn more about Avalon first-hand, please go here to schedule a tour specifically designed for educators.
        <br><br>
        For a more intensive immersion experience, please see our current packages.
        <br><br>
        Finally, Avalon is joining forces with the Center for Teaching Quality (CTQ) to host next yearâ€™s <a href="http://www.teacherpowered.org/conference">National Conference for Teacher-Powered Schools</a>.
        <br><br>
