        <h3 class="content-headline">Why Project Based Learning?</h3>
        <p>Project Based Learning promotes all the skills students need to succeed in the modern world: critical thinking, problem-solving, perseverance and effective communication.  Further, Avalon’s PBL model allows students to develop these essential traits while following their own individual passions: students literally design their own learning.  This personalized approach increases student engagement, self-efficacy, and ownership.</p>

        <h3 class="content-subhead">Is my student ready?</h3>
        <p>Students do not have to come to Avalon knowing how to undertake and manage projects.  That’s what we teach them!  Knowing how to identify your passions and your goals, and then how to develop a plan to reach them is fundamental to life in today’s ever-changing world.  Graduates of Avalon are highly skilled learners and are ready to take on the world.

        <h3 class="content-headline">The Project Process</h3>
        <p>At Avalon, we break the project process into 4 basic steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Plan: begin researching and gathering sources, think about your deliverable, check in with both your advisor and an advisor in the field of study.</li>
          <li>Propose:  create the tasks and milestones that will guide you through the project, formally propose the project with two advisors utilizing Project Foundry, create a rubric for grading purposes, write your task deadlines in your planner.</li>
          <li>Do: research, create, revise, edit, check in with advisors, research some more, revise your deliverable again.</li>
          <li>Finalize: write a reflection, polish up deliverable, meet with the same two advisors you proposed with, agree on a grade, think about what your next project will be about.</li>
        </ol>
