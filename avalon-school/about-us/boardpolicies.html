        <h4>Regina Goldner</h4>
        <p>In 2005, Avalon School was introduced to Regina Goldner.

She is just as proud of her Masters in Education from the University of Minnesota and knows that teaching is the job of her dreams and Avalon the school which she loves.  She is also the board treasurer.</p>

        <h4>Chris Jandro</h4>
        <p>After leaving the contentment that the cows and colleges of Northfield provided him throughout his childhood, Chris graduated from Macalester College in 2004 with degrees in Biology and Environmental Studies.  He took a hiatus from studying to paint houses with the family business, and when he spent a month at an environmental education camp (Camp Widjiwagan-near Ely, MN), he realized that he was to become an educator.
        <br><br>
        In the fall of 2006 he both enrolled in Hamline’s Master of Arts in Teaching program and started working at Avalon Charter School as an educational assistant.  He left Avalon in May of 2008 for Peru to do his student teaching, and returned in the fall as a licensed teacher!  He has enjoyed working at Avalon ever since in his roles as Advisor, Technology Coordinator, High School Seminar Instructor, Middle School Science Teacher, and now board member.
        When Chris is not busy teaching, he can usually be found enjoying the outdoors.
        Chris is also the board secretary.</p>

In line with the personalized learning she received during her six years at Avalon, Holly will be designing her undergraduate program at Metropolitan State University in political science, education policy, and environmental policy reform.

Holly currently attends school while working full-time for State Senator Bev Scalze, vice chair of the Capital Investment Committee.</p>

        <h4>Tim Quealy</h4>
        <p>Tim started at Avalon School in the winter of the 2007-2008 school year.  Attending Hamline’s Masters in Teaching program during the evenings to earn his teaching credentials, Tim began at Avalon as an Education Assistant.  After two and a half enjoyable years as an EA, Tim was hired as a full time advisor in the high school, and has been there ever since.  Tim is licensed in the Language Arts.  Tim also loves math, technology, and terrible jokes.
        <br><br>
        Previously, Tim worked for several years as a wilderness guide, leading canoe trips in the Boundary Waters and Quetico wilderness areas, kayak trips on Lake Superior, and hiking trips wherever he could find a trail.  Tim has also coached the varsity boys’ soccer team at another high school for the past six years.
        <br>
        When not at school, Tim can be found outside on the trails and parks of Minneapolis.  Or sometimes inside, watching soccer.</p>

        <h4>Rinal Ray</h4>
        <p>Rinal Ray joined the Minnesota Council of Nonprofits as the public policy advocate in 2014.  Rinal works to advance the organization’s policy agenda and train leaders on nonprofit and legislative advocacy.  Prior to her role at MCN, Rinal served as a staff attorney for the Minnesota Justice Foundation at William Mitchell College of Law increasing the capacity of legal service organizations to serve low-income community members through law student volunteers.  A former Project Coordinator for MCN, she also worked on the Charitable Tax Exemption Campaign and the Nonprofit Legal Handbook. Additionally, Rinal served on MCN’s Board of Directors in 2013 and as a co-chair of the Principles and Practices Advisory Committee.  She is a former board member, governance committee chair, and board chair for the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network of the Twin Cities.
        <br><br>
        Rinal was an AmeriCorps member with College Possible and currently serves on its Former Corps Council. In law school, she clerked for the Third District Public Defender’s Office, Legal Aid’s Youth Law Project, taught Street Law, and volunteered with an immigrant advocate at the Hennepin County Office of Multicultural Services.

        <h4>Laura Savin</h4>
        <p>Laura Savin is the parent of two students who attended Avalon. Her oldest son attended Avalon during its first year of existence and her younger son graduated in 2009. She is the executive director of the foundation and alumni relations at Saint Paul College – A Community and Technical College. She has a law degree from Hamline University and a BA in English from the University of Minnesota. She and her husband live in St. Paul.</p>

        <h4>Jo Sullivan</h4>
        <p>Jo Sullivan has an unusual background for a high school teacher, but the many hats she has worn in her various work experiences provide her with a rich experiential history in the sciences and a wealth of real world experiences to share with students (one of the advantages of aging, she says). After teaching chemistry and biology for five years in the late 70’s, Jo spent the next twenty years working in the health care area for 3M including several years in Europe as a European marketing manager. After leaving 3M, Jo decided to come full circle by teaching because of her desire to “make a difference” and her recognition being with teenagers makes her happy (She has raised two of her own.).
        <br><br>
        Jo received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biology from Oberlin College and a Master’s degree in Medical Genetics from the University of Wisconsin.
        <br><br>
        Jo has been a researcher (cancer research and clinical research), published research in medical journals, helped write a drug application to the FDA, planned and organized medical seminars, and lectured on biological topics in at least 12 countries. Jo has always enjoyed biology, but says it is especially fun to teach at this time because of the biological renaissance in our midst, thanks to programs like the Genome project. Her favorite saying, which she learned from her dad is, “Plus the pluses and minus the minuses.”</p>

        <h4>Anna Wesley</h4>
        <p>Anna Wesley first heard about Avalon when she was attending Hamline University’s College of Liberal Arts. She first experienced Avalon when she was assigned a practicum during her junior year as part of her education coursework. She loved Avalon and its community so much that she stayed during the next year as an aide to teachers and students. After graduating from Hamline and armed with a Language Arts teaching certificate, Anna taught at an alternative school in south Minneapolis while still keeping in touch with friends at Avalon. She heard Avalon’s call again in the spring of 2005 when she found out about the new and exciting opportunity of teaching in Avalon’s middle school program and she couldn’t resist once again being part of this amazing community.
        <br><br>
        When Anna is not teaching and telling people how great teaching middle-schoolers is, she can usually be found reading, baking, playing outside with her two kiddos, working on her house, or spending time with her friends and family. Anna also is a huge fan of the Midway neighborhood and the Twin Cities in general and likes to spend time enjoying the music, food, sports, art, and people that make up these areas, as long as she has good directions.</p>
