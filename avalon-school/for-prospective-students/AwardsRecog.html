        <h3 class="content-subhead">Avalon appears in another research paper!</h3>
        <p>
        A research paper about Avalon was recently published on the <a href="http://imp.sagepub.com/">Improving Schools</a> website (March 11 Vol. 14 no.1).  It was written by Scott Wurdinger and Walter Enloe.  The abstract follows, and the <a href="http://www.avalonschool.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Mankato-Research.pdf">full report can be read here</a>.
        <br><br>
        Surveys that focused on academic and life skill development were collected from alumni who attended Avalon Charter School in St Paul, Minnesota. Avalon is a small public charter school that uses project-based learning as their primary teaching method. Forty-two alumni responded to the online survey. Students ranked life skills such as creativity, problem solving, and time management extremely high, whereas academic skills such as note taking and test taking were ranked much lower. Students graduate from this school with a strong sense of purpose and self-confidence, which helps them become productive members of society.
