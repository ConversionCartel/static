        <p>
        <em>Does Avalon School charge tuition fees?</em>
        <br>
        As a public, non-profit charter school, Avalon is free for all students in the state of Minnesota.
        <br><br>
        <em>How do I apply to Avalon School?</em>
        <br>
        Applying at Avalon is simple - just click the button to the left/right/up/down to visit our SchoolAdmin.com portal, then complete an application form online. You can also request a hard copy paper application by visiting or calling our front office at 651.649.5495 ext. 200. You will receive a confirmation e-mail once your form has been submitted.
        <br><br>
        <em>Can interested families and students tour or shadow at Avalon?</em>
        <br>
        Yes! We provide tours twice a week (Tuesdays at 1pm, Fridays at 9:15am) and can schedule a half-day shadowing experience on most normal school days. Click on the link here to sign up for a tour, a shadowing experience, or both.
        <br><br>
        <em>What transportation is available for students to use to get to/from school?</em>
        <br>
        Avalon provides Metro Transit bus passes to all students who live more than 2.0 miles away from our school. The bus pass options include an unlimited ride pass, or a 10-ride pass for students who rely on public transit on a less than daily basis. Students and families must complete a transportation agreement form before being issued their desired bus pass.
        <br><br>
        <em>What are the daily hours of operation at Avalon?</em>
        <br>
        Our regular school day starts at 9am and ends at 3:40pm. Our building is open on Monday-Thursday from 8am to 4:30pm and on Friday from 8am-4pm. If your student needs to wait for a ride after our building hours close, they are welcome to wait outside of our building or at one of many nearby establishments (coffee shops, restaurants, Mid-Continent Oceanographic Institute).
        <br><br>
        <em>What sports or extracurricular programming is available at Avalon?</em>
        <br>
        Avalon is part of the MN State High School League (MSHSL), meaning that any students that attend Avalon are eligible to participate in sports team through other organizations, including their home districts. While Avalon is an active member of the MSHSL, we do not currently sponsor any competitive teams.  To participate in a sport at another school, Avalon must reach a cooperative agreement with the host school, which has no obligation to agree.  Because each school charges a fee for sports, Avalon will pay 50% of the participation fee for families who do not qualify for free or reduced lunch. Avalon will pay 100% of the participation fee for students eligible for free lunch and 75% of the participation fee for students eligible for reduced lunch. In order to receive funding from the school, students must complete a formal proposal with the Board.  Budgeted funds will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis, though it is possible that in the case of high demand, more funds will be raised later in the year. Finally, if a student receives funding assistance but fails to follow through (quits in the middle of the season, etc), the student may be responsible for the funds.
        <br><br>
        Avalon offers a series of extracurricular activities that take place during and after regular school hours.
